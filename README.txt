Final ECE 287 Project.

How it works:

- Make sure all switches are off.

- Adjust the speed of the notes to your liking using Switches 2 and 1.
	- No switches is slowest.
	- SW[1] is the next slowest.
	- SW[1] and SW[2] together is the medium speed.
	- SW[2] is the fastest.

- When you are ready to play, turn SW[9] on

- KEY[2], KEY[1], and KEY[0] corrispond to their respective columns left to right. Press the keys down as the notes fall within the window.
Be careful not to press the keys too early as you can lose points.

- KEY[3] will reset the system (small note, turn SW[9] off before resetting as the vga delay can result a note already falling down).

- Each column/note has their own sound emitting through the audio ports (headphones with correct inputs are required)Final ECE 287 Project.
